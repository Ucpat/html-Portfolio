<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Uchechi Patience Okpegbuo, is an interesting individual who loves to learn.</p>

<p> Knowledge is an asset that opens the door for great conversations and connections.</p>

<p>Realising that my freedom is of paramount importance to me, I took a decision to learn web designing,
  and I'm glad I did. Coding is fun, and it is surely the best way to have fun and twist your brain, which is what I love.
